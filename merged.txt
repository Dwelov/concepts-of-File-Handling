This is my first file operation in C++.

Steps to Create a File in C++.

The following are the steps involved to create the files.

Include the header file: You need <fstream> which provides classes for file handling.

Use ofstream class: ofstream is used to create and write to files.

When you open a file using ofstream, if the file doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically.

Open the file: You can open a file either by passing the filename in the constructor or using .open() method.

Write to the file: Use the insertion operator (<<) to write content.

Close the file: Always close the file using .close() to free resources.

This is a new line added to the file.

This is a new line added to the file.

## 📝 5 Practice Programs for File Handling

- **[Program 1: Create & Write Records](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%201%3A%20Create%20%26%20Write%20Records)**  
  Write a program that creates a new file called `students.txt` and stores 5 student records (ID, Name, Marks). Use `ofstream` with `ios::trunc` so the file is overwritten each time.  
  *Key concept:* File creation and writing.

- **[Program 2: Append Records](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%202%3A%20Append%20Records)**  
  Extend the file by adding new student records without deleting the old ones. Use `ofstream` with `ios::app`.  
  *Key concept:* Appending data safely.

- **[Program 3: Read & Display Records](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%203%3A%20Read%20%26%20Display%20Records)**  
  Read the file line by line using `ifstream` and `getline()`. Display all records neatly.  
  *Key concept:* Reading files and handling line input.

- **[Program 4: Search by ID](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%204%3A%20Search%20by%20ID)**  
  Ask the user for an ID, then scan the file line by line. Use `find()` to check if the ID exists in a record. Print the record if found.  
  *Key concept:* Searching text inside files.

- **[Program 5: Update & Delete Records](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%205%3A%20Update%20%26%20Delete%20Records)**  
  Read all records into a vector, modify or skip the target record, then rewrite the file with `ofstream` using `ios::trunc`.  
  *Key concept:* Updating and deleting by rewritiing
