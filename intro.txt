  *Key concept:* File creation and writing.

- **[Program 2: Append Records](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%202%3A%20Append%20Records)**  
  Extend the file by adding new student records without deleting the old ones. Use `ofstream` with `ios::app`.  
  *Key concept:* Appending data safely.

  Ask the user for an ID, then scan the file line by line. Use `find()` to check if the ID exists in a record. Print the record if found.  
  *Key concept:* Searching text inside files.

- **[Program 5: Update & Delete Records](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Program%205%3A%20Update%20%26%20Delete%20Records)**
