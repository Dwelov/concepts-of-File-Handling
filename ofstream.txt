This is my first file operation in C++
Steps to Create a File in C++
The following are the steps involved to create the files.
Include the header file: You need <fstream> which provides classes for file handling.
Use ofstream class: ofstream is used to create and write to files.
When you open a file using ofstream, if the file doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically.
Open the file: You can open a file either by passing the filename in the constructor or using .open() method.
Write to the file: Use the insertion operator (<<) to write content.
Close the file: Always close the file using .close() to free resources.
